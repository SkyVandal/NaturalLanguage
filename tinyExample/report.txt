//TODO - tirar tudo da diretoria /tinyExample e apagar esta diretoria

We decided to do our testing part using the third testing option from the original "run.sh".
All our tests are done within the run.sh file, so we did not have the need to create test files in the /tests directory.
When running the "run.sh" file all the test cases will be displayed as the output in the terminal.
